First, set your Sauce username and Sauce access key [as environment variables](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Best+Practice%3A+Use+Environment+Variables+for+Authentication+Credentials), then Simple Sauce can be used like this:
```
from simplesauce.session import SauceSession

session = SauceSession()

driver = session.driver
driver.get("www.saucedemo.com")

session.stop("passed")
```
