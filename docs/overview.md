## The Idea - Making Sauce Simple To Use

Writing and maintaining automated good test frameworks is hard work. Sauce Labs wants to help make this work simpler. We've created Simple Sauce, a collection of tools to make connecting to and working with Sauce Labs simple.

Simple Sauce has three main goals:

-   Providing test developers with a wrapper or _binding_ for each programming language commonly used with web and mobile testing,
-   Providing a concise API for connecting to Sauce Labs in test frameworks and making use of Sauce Labs features,
-   Providing an excellent developer user experience for using Sauce Labs in a straightforward, intuitive way.

The focus of this project is to make using Sauce Labs _simple_ so that test developers can focus on developing the best automated test frameworks possible for their teams.

## Supported Language Bindings

This project is a cross-language effort, with bindings available in the following languages:

-   [Java](https://github.com/saucelabs/simple_sauce/tree/master/java),
-   [C#](https://github.com/saucelabs/simple_sauce/tree/master/dotnet),
-   [Python](https://github.com/saucelabs/simple_sauce/tree/master/python),
-   [Ruby](https://github.com/saucelabs/simple_sauce/tree/master/ruby).

Each binding balances having a shared API and feature set while being idiomatic to the language and ecosystem the binding is a part of. Each feature should be available in all language bindings.
